# Air-Quality-Vs-Income-By-County-California

First, we decided to analyze the air quality and income based on counties within California. We found the data using public datasets that we searched for. 

We found the income data,which was income per capita per county in 2023, [over here](https://hdpulse.nimhd.nih.gov/data-portal/physical/table?age=001&age_options=ageall_1&demo=234&demo_options=air_pollution_1&physicaltopic=002&physicaltopic_options=physical_2&race=00&race_options=raceall_1&sex=0&sex_options=sexboth_1&statefips=06&statefips_options=area_states).

We found the air quality data, which was measured in Micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) [over here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?eid=266305&rid=175).
