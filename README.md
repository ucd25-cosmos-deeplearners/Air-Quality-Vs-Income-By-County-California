# Air-Quality-Vs-Income-By-County-California

## Data Acquisition

First, we decided to analyze the air quality and income based on counties within California. We found the data using public datasets that we searched for. 

We found the income data,which was income per capita per county in 2023, [here](https://hdpulse.nimhd.nih.gov/data-portal/physical/table?age=001&age_options=ageall_1&demo=234&demo_options=air_pollution_1&physicaltopic=002&physicaltopic_options=physical_2&race=00&race_options=raceall_1&sex=0&sex_options=sexboth_1&statefips=06&statefips_options=area_states).

We found the air quality data, which was measured in Micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?eid=266305&rid=175).

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

Next, we created a scatterplot to graph the Air Pollution vs. the Income for all the counties and encountered a few outliers. We used a mathematical formula, called the IQR rule to remove the outliers so a trend would be more visible. 

To find a correlation, we used linear regression to get a line of best fit. We found the correlation coefficient $r^2 \approx{-0.30}$, which indicates some negative correlation. This means the lower the air pollution, the higher the incomes; however, to reiterate, this is a weak correlation.
